This is a series of python programs written to help me complete my FINA2322 course.
This directory includes programs to compute profits of different options and their combinations, including:
longcall
longput
shortcall
shortput
longstrangle
shortstrangle

as straddle is just a case of strangle, I did not include straddle.

The input data are shown in options.txt, extracted from hang seng index hk.
The data includes 8 puts and 8 calls. for data in different size, parameters in py programs need to be adjusted accordingly.
